This interactive data visualization app offers a thorough examination of data pertaining to drug use and smoking among young people. 
This app provides a dynamic method to examine important patterns in the data by employing a variety of visualization techniques, including line charts, bar charts, pie charts, scatter plots, heatmaps, and box plots. These techniques highlight the connections between various factors, including age, gender, socioeconomic status, mental health, and peer influence.

    This graphic shows us if smoking rates have gone up, down, or stayed the same, as well as whether gender influences these patterns. The dynamic structure of the graphic provides important insights into the smoking behavior of young people by illustrating how social shifts or public health initiatives may have affected smoking rates over time.

For instance, smoking rates may be greater among older teenagers than among younger people, or smoking prevalence may noticeably decline among particular age groups, which may be the result of effective anti-smoking initiatives aimed at particular age groups.

### Conclusion:
Numerous important insights into the intricate links between different elements, including age, gender, peer influence, and mental health, are revealed by the examination of data on youth drug use and smoking. We have seen how smoking prevalence has changed over time, with differences across age and gender categories, thanks to the various visualizations. While the bar charts provided a comparison of smoking rates by age group, the line charts assisted in tracking smoking patterns. Notably, age has a big impact on smoking habits because younger people often have lower prevalence rates than older teenagers. The gender distribution is clarified by the pie charts, which also show if smoking and drug experimenting practices differ by gender. Additionally, the box plots showed the distribution of drug experimentation across various age categories, giving a clear picture of the data's distribution and anomalies. Peer influence can be a major factor in the initiation and maintenance of smoking behaviors, especially in specific years and demographic groups, according to the heatmap of smoking prevalence and peer influence across time, which revealed a high association. Peer influence and age groups were further highlighted by the scatter plot with a regression line, which suggested that peer pressure appears to rise with age. Lastly, the relationship between higher rates of drug usage and worse mental health is highlighted by the histogram that shows drug experimentation and mental health. All things considered, these graphics highlight how critical it is to comprehend the different socioenvironmental elements that influence teen drug and smoking use. The evidence clearly indicates that Mitigating smoking and drug experimenting behaviors may be made possible by focused treatments that concentrate on particular age groups, gender, and the elimination of peer influence. Additionally, addressing mental health issues may be crucial to lowering young people's likelihood of using drugs. These results highlight the necessity of specialized public health approaches to deal with these related problems and lay the groundwork for further studies meant to comprehend and reduce teen drug and smoking experimentation.""")
